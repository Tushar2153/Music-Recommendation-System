# 🎵 Music Recommender System

This project is a content-based music recommender system that suggests similar songs based on their lyrics. The model is built using TF-IDF and Cosine Similarity, and the application is deployed as an interactive web app using Streamlit.

The app provides the top 5 song recommendations and fetches their official album covers using the Spotify API.

## ✨ Features

* **Content-Based Filtering:** Recommends songs based on lyrical similarity.
* **Interactive UI:** Built with Streamlit, allowing users to select a song from a dropdown menu.
* **Top 5 Recommendations:** Displays the 5 most similar songs:`].
* **Spotify API Integration:** Fetches and displays real album covers for each recommended song.

## ⚙️ How It Works (Methodology)

The recommendation model was built using the steps outlined in the `modeltrain.pdf` notebook:

1.  [cite_start]**Data Loading:** The project uses the `spotify_millsongdata.csv` dataset [cite: 2][cite_start], which was then sampled down to 5,000 songs for performance[cite: 6, 23].
2.  **Text Preprocessing:** The song lyrics (`text` column) were cleaned using:
    * [cite_start]**Lowercasing:** All text was converted to lowercase[cite: 25].
    * [cite_start]**Tokenization:** Lyrics were broken into individual words using `nltk.word_tokenize`[cite: 31].
    * [cite_start]**Stemming:** Words were reduced to their root form using `PorterStemmer`[cite: 27, 29].
3.  [cite_start]**Feature Extraction (TF-IDF):** The preprocessed lyrics were transformed into a numerical matrix using `TfidfVectorizer`[cite: 36]. This process gives weight to words that are important to a song but not common across all songs.
4.  [cite_start]**Similarity Calculation:** `cosine_similarity` was used to compute a similarity score between all songs in the dataset[cite: 37]. [cite_start]The resulting similarity matrix is saved as `similarity.pkl`[cite: 77].
5.  **Recommendation:** The Streamlit app loads the processed DataFrame (`df.pkl`) and the `similarity.pkl` matrix. When a user selects a song, the app finds that song's index, retrieves its similarity scores against all other songs, and returns the 5 songs with the highest scores == song].index[0]`, `distances = sorted(...)`, `for i in distances[1:6]:`].

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Python**
* [cite_start]**Pandas:** For data manipulation[cite: 1].
* [cite_start]**Scikit-learn:** For `TfidfVectorizer` and `cosine_similarity`[cite: 34].
* [cite_start]**NLTK:** For text tokenization and stemming[cite: 26, 27].
* **Streamlit:** To create the interactive web application.
* **Spotipy:** Python client for the Spotify Web API (to get album covers).
* [cite_start]**Pickle:** For saving and loading the trained model and processed data[cite: 76, 77, 78].

## 🚀 How to Run

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git)
    cd your-repository-name
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    It's recommended to use a virtual environment.
    ```bash
    pip install pandas scikit-learn nltk streamlit spotipy
    ```
    *You will also need to download NLTK data:*
    ```python
    import nltk
    nltk.download('punkt')
    ```

3.  **Get Spotify API Credentials:**
    * Go to the [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/).
    * Create an app to get your `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET`.
    * Open `app.py` and replace the placeholder credentials with your own:
        ```python
        CLIENT_ID = "YOUR_CLIENT_ID"
        CLIENT_SECRET = "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET"
        ```

4.  **Ensure Model Files are Present:**
    This project requires the `df.pkl` and `similarity.pkl` files, which are generated by the `modeltrain.pdf` notebook. Make sure they are in the same directory as `app.py`.

5.  **Run the Streamlit App:**
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```
    Your app will open in your web browser.

## 📊 Dataset

[cite_start]This model is trained on a sample of 5,000 songs [cite: 23] from the **Spotify Million Song Dataset**. [cite_start]The original dataset (`spotify_millsongdata.csv`) contains 57,650 songs[cite: 6]. [cite_start]The columns used for this project are `artist`, `song`, and `text` (lyrics)[cite: 4, 8, 9, 10].
